The relevant data can likely be mmapped simply by passing a buffer object alongside existing functions and reusing it where desired.

- visit __setstate__ etc and construct data as directly backed by bytes or memoryview
- use a buffer format that pickle preserves the bytes object from as read, this may be already the case or may require code mutation
- unpickle file object that returns mmap'd data from read()

could also use a different storage format if working on system with enough ram to convert
